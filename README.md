**Please note: this theme is not being updated or maintained as I've moved on to Sublime Text. If you're interested in this theme you should check out toureiffel's fork at https://github.com/toureiffel/Waher-style-npp.**

This is my personal repo for my own version of [Waher](http://waher.net/archives/1013), the beautiful Notepad++ theme by Kristo Vaher. Nothing has changed just yet, just an initial commit, but I plan to incorporate fixes and add support for more filetypes (.htaccess being the first probably).
